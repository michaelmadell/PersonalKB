Creating a VLAN With Internet Access:
Assuming:
Main Network is 192.168.0.0/24
Vlan is vlan2
Vlan network is 192.168.1.1/24

1 - Set vmbr0 to vlan aware
2 - ensure ip forwarding is enabled:
  - add "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" to /etc/sysctl.conf
  - run "sysctl -p" to check the rule is correct
3 - run "iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.1.0/24 -o vmbr0 -j MASQUERADE"
4 - run "sudo /etc/init.d/iptables-persistent save"
5 - assign vmbr0 with VLAN 2 to the VM
6 - Boot VM and assign static IP e.g. 192.168.1.10
7 - VM Should have Internet Access on the VLAN
